                                understanding how two black holes
                                can come together and merge.</p>
                                <p>On the 14th September 2015,
                                Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer
                                Gravitational-wave Observatory)
                                detected gravitational waves from
                                the collision of a pair of black
                                holes, dubbed GW150914. Since then,
                                Advanced LIGO has been joined by
                                Advanced Virgo. Together, Advanced
                                LIGO and Virgo observed GW170817,
                                gravitational waves from the
                                inspiral and merger of a pair of
                                neutron stars. This event was
                                subsequently observed across the
                                electromagnetic spectrum, including
                                as a gamma ray burst and kilonova.
                                At the end of their first two
                                observing runs, Advanced LIGO and
                                Virgo had totalled up 10 binary
                                black hole mergers and one binary
                                neutron star merger. Their third
                                observing run finished in March
                                2020.</p>
                                <p>These observations confirmed a
                                major prediction of Albert
                                Einstein's 1915 general theory of
                                relativity and opened an
                                unprecedented new window onto the
                                cosmos. However, we still do not
                                know how such pairs of merging
                                black holes and neutron stars
                                form.</p>
                                <p>In order for black holes to
                                merge within the age of the
                                Universe by emitting gravitational
                                waves, they must start out close
                                together by astronomical standards,
                                no more than about a fifth of the
                                distance between the Earth and the
                                Sun for the heaviest LIGO sources.
                                However, massive stars, which are
                                the progenitors of the black holes
                                that LIGO observes, expand to be
                                much larger than this in the course
                                of their evolution. The key
                                challenge, then, is how to fit such
                                large stars within a very small
                                orbit. <a href=

                                    We conduct a binary population synthesis study to investigate the formationof wind-fed high-mass X-ray binaries containing black holes (BH-HMXBs). Weevolve multiple populations of high-mass binary stars and consider BH-HMXBformation rates, masses, spins and separations. We find that systems similar toCygnus X-1 likely form after stable Case A mass transfer (MT) from the mainsequence progenitors of black holes, provided such MT is characterised by lowaccretion efficiency, $\beta \lesssim 0.1$, with modest orbital angularmomentum losses from the non-accreted material. Additionally, BH-HMXB formationrelies on a new simple treatment for Case A MT that allows donors to retainlarger core masses compared to traditional rapid population-synthesisprocedures. At solar metallicity, our Preferred model yields $\mathcal{O}(1)$observable BH-HMXBs in the Galaxy today, consistent with observations. In thissimulation, $8\%$ of BH-HMXBs go on to merge as binary black holes or neutronstar-black hole binaries within a Hubble time. Compact-object mergers thatevolve via a BH-HMXB phase may contribute $\gtrsim20$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ tothe merger rate inferred from gravitational-wave observations. We also suggestthat MT efficiency is higher during stable Case B MT than during Case A MT.

                                    The Milky Way is believed to host hundreds of millions of quiescentstellar-mass black holes (BHs). In the last decade, some of these objects havebeen potentially uncovered via gravitational microlensing events. All thesedetections resulted in a degeneracy between the velocity and the mass of thelens. This degeneracy has been lifted, for the first time, with the recentastrometric microlensing detection of OB110462. However, two independentstudies reported very different lens mass for this event. Sahu et al. (2022)inferred a lens mass of 7.1 $\pm$ 1.3 Msun, consistent with a BH, while Lam etal. (2022) inferred 1.6-4.2 Msun, consistent with either a neutron star or aBH. Here, we study the landscape of isolated BHs formed in the field. Inparticular, we focus on the mass and center-of-mass speed of foursub-populations: isolated BHs from single-star origin, disrupted BHs ofbinary-star origin, main-sequence stars with a compact object companion, anddouble compact object mergers. Our model predicts that most ($\gtrsim$ 70%)isolated BHs in the Milky Way are of binary origin. However, non-interactionslead to most massive BHs ($\gtrsim$ 15-20 Msun) being predominantly of singleorigin. Under the assumption that OB110462 is a free-floating compact object weconclude that it is more likely to be a BH originally belonging to a binarysystem. Our results suggest that low-mass BH microlensing events can be usefulto understand binary evolution of massive stars in the Milky Way, whilehigh-mass BH lenses can be useful to probe single stellar evolution.

                                    Rapidly growing catalogs of compact binary mergers from advancedgravitational-wave detectors allow us to explore the astrophysics of massivestellar binaries. Merger observations can constrain the uncertain parametersthat describe the underlying processes in the evolution of stars and binarysystems in population models. In this paper, we demonstrate that binary blackhole populations - namely, detection rates, chirp masses, and redshifts - canbe used to measure cosmological parameters describing the redshift-dependentstar formation rate and metallicity distribution. We present a method that usesartificial neural networks to emulate binary population synthesis computermodels, and construct a fast, flexible, parallelisable surrogate model that weuse for inference.

                                    In this work, we explore the connection between the gravitational wave (GW)merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) and galaxy properties. Wedo this by generating populations of stars using the binary synthesis codeCOMPAS and evolving them in galaxies from the semi-analytic galaxy formationmodel {\sc Shark}, to determine the number of mergers occurring in eachsimulation time-step. We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high starformation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events comparedto younger, more metal poor galaxies. Our simulation with the default inputparameters predicts a higher local merger rate density compared to the thirdgravitational wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) prediction from LIGO, VIRGO andKAGRA. This is due to short coalescence times, low metallicities and an highformation rate of stars at low redshift in the galaxy simulation, whichproduces more BBHs that merge within the age of the Universe compared toobservations. We identify alternate remnant mass models that more accuratelyreproduce the observed volumetric rate and provide updated fits to the mergerrate distribution as a function of redshift. We then investigate the relativefraction of GW events in our simulation volume that are in observable hostgalaxies from different upcoming photometric and spectroscopic surveys,determining which of those are more ideal for tracing host galaxies with highmerger rates. The implications of this work can be utilised for numerousapplications, including for constraining stellar evolution models, betterinforming follow-up programs, and placing more informative priors on potentialhost galaxies when measuring cosmological parameters such as the Hubbleconstant.

                                    We perform population synthesis of massive binaries to study the mergers ofneutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) with the cores of their giantsecondaries during common envelope evolution (CEE). We use different values ofthe efficiency parameter $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ in the framework of the energyformalism for traditional CEE ($\alpha_{\rm CE} \leq 1$) and includingadditional energy sources to unbind the envelope ($\alpha_{\rm CE} &gt; 1$). Weconstrain the possible values of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ by comparing the results ofour simulations with local rate densities of binary compact object mergers asinferred from gravitational waves observations. We find two primaryevolutionary pathways of binary systems that result in NS-core mergers, whileonly one of them can also lead to the merger of a BH with the core of the giantstar. We explore the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) statistical properties ofsystems that result in NS/BH-core mergers and find that the two evolutionarychannels correspond to a bimodal distribution of orbital separations. Weestimate the percentage of the mergers&#39; event rates relative to core collapsesupernovae (CCSNe). We include the effect of mass accreted by the NS/BH duringCEE in a separate set of simulations and find it does not affect the mergers&#39;event rates.

                                    Binary population synthesis provides a direct way of studying the effects ofdifferent choices of binary evolution models and initial parameterdistributions on present-day binary compact merger populations, which can thenbe compared to empirical properties such as observed merger rates. Samples ofzero-age main sequence binaries to be evolved by such codes are typicallygenerated from an universal IMF and simple, uniform, distributions for orbitalperiod $P$, mass ratio $q$ and eccentricity $e$. More recently, however,mounting observational evidence has suggested the non-universality of the IMFand the existence of correlations between binary parameters. In this study, weimplement a metallicity- and redshift-dependent IMF alongside correlateddistributions for $P$, $q$ and $e$ in order to generate representativepopulations of binaries at varying redshifts, which are then evolved with theCOMPAS code in order to study the variations in merger rates and overallpopulation properties.

                                    Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes can be used to shed lighton poorly understood aspects of massive binary stellar evolution, such as theevolution of massive stars (including their mass-loss rates), the commonenvelope phase, and the rate at which massive stars form throughout the cosmichistory of the Universe. In this paper we explore the \emph{correlated} impactof these phases on predictions for the merger rate and chirp mass distributionof merging binary black holes, aiming to identify possible degeneracies betweenmodel parameters. In many of our models, a large fraction (more than 70% ofdetectable binary black holes) arise from the chemically homogeneous evolutionscenario; these models tend to over-predict the binary black hole merger rateand produce systems which are on average too massive. Our preferred modelsfavour enhanced mass-loss rates for helium rich Wolf--Rayet stars, in tensionwith recent theoretical and observational developments. We identifycorrelations between the impact of the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars andthe metallicity evolution of the Universe on the rates and properties ofmerging binary black holes. Based on the observed mass distribution, we arguethat the $\sim 10\%$ of binary black holes with chirp masses greater than $40$M$_\odot$ (the maximum predicted by our models) are unlikely to have formedthrough isolated binary evolution, implying a significant contribution (&gt; 10%)from other formation channels such as dense star clusters or active galacticnuclei. Our models will enable inference on the uncertain parameters governingbinary evolution in the near future.

                                    Gravitational-wave (GW) detections are starting to reveal features in themass distribution of double compact objects. The lower end of the black hole(BH) mass distribution is especially interesting as few formation channelscontribute here and because it is more robust against variations in the cosmicstar formation than the high mass end. In this work we explore the stable masstransfer channel for the formation of GW sources with a focus on the low-massend of the mass distribution. We conduct an extensive exploration of theuncertain physical processes that impact this channel. We note that, forfiducial assumptions, this channel reproduces the peak at $\sim9\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in the GW-observed binary BH mass distribution remarkablywell, and predicts a cutoff mass that coincides with the upper edge of thepurported neutron star BH mass gap. The peak and cutoff mass are a consequenceof unique properties of this channel, namely (1) the requirement of stabilityduring the mass transfer phases, and (2) the complex way in which the finalcompact object masses scale with the initial mass. We provide an analyticalexpression for the cutoff in the primary component mass and show that thisadequately matches our numerical results. Our results imply that selectioneffects resulting from the formation channel alone can provide an explanationfor the purported neutron star--BH mass gap in GW detections. This provides analternative to the commonly adopted view that the gap emerges during BHformation.

                                    Making the most of the rapidly increasing population of gravitational-wavedetections of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) mergers requires comparingobservations with population synthesis predictions. In this work we investigatethe combined impact from the key uncertainties in population synthesismodelling of the isolated binary evolution channel: the physical processes inmassive binary-star evolution and the star formation history as a function ofmetallicity, $Z$, and redshift $z, \mathcal{S}(Z,z)$. Considering theseuncertainties we create 560 different publicly available model realizations andcalculate the rate and distribution characteristics of detectable BHBH, BHNS,and NSNS mergers. We find that our stellar evolution and $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$variations can impact the predicted intrinsic and detectable merger rates byfactors $10^2$-$10^4$. We find that BHBH rates are dominantly impacted by$\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ variations, NSNS rates by stellar evolution variations andBHNS rates by both. We then consider the combined impact from all uncertaintiesconsidered in this work on the detectable mass distribution shapes (chirp mass,individual masses and mass ratio). We find that the BHNS mass distributions arepredominantly impacted by massive binary-star evolution changes. For BHBH andNSNS we find that both uncertainties are important. We also find that the shapeof the delay time and birth metallicity distributions are typically dominatedby the choice of $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS. We identifyseveral examples of robust features in the mass distributions predicted by all560 models, such that we expect more than 95% of BHBH detections to contain aBH $\gtrsim 8\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and have mass ratios $\lesssim 4$. Our workdemonstrates that it is essential to consider a wide range of allowed models tostudy double compact object merger rates and properties.

                                    Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes can be used to shed lighton poorly understood aspects of massive binary stellar evolution, such as theevolution of massive stars (including their mass-loss rates), the commonenvelope phase, and the rate at which massive stars form throughout the cosmichistory of the Universe. In this paper we explore the \emph{correlated} impactof these phases on predictions for the merger rate and chirp mass distributionof merging binary black holes, aiming to identify possible degeneracies betweenmodel parameters. In many of our models, a large fraction (more than 70% ofdetectable binary black holes) arise from the chemically homogeneous evolutionscenario; these models tend to over-predict the binary black hole merger rateand produce systems which are on average too massive. Our preferred modelsfavour enhanced mass-loss rates for helium rich Wolf--Rayet stars, in tensionwith recent theoretical and observational developments. We identifycorrelations between the impact of the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars andthe metallicity evolution of the Universe on the rates and properties ofmerging binary black holes. Based on the observed mass distribution, we arguethat the $\sim 10\%$ of binary black holes with chirp masses greater than $40$M$_\odot$ (the maximum predicted by our models) are unlikely to have formedthrough isolated binary evolution, implying a significant contribution (&gt; 10%)from other formation channels such as dense star clusters or active galacticnuclei. Our models will enable inference on the uncertain parameters governingbinary evolution in the near future.

                                    Future searches for gravitational waves from space will be sensitive todouble compact objects (DCOs) in our Milky Way. We present new simulations ofthe populations of double black holes (BHBHs), black hole neutron stars (BHNSs)and double neutron stars (NSNSs) that will be detectable by the plannedspace-based gravitational wave detector LISA. For our estimates, we use anempirically-informed model of the metallicity dependent star formation historyof the Milky Way. We populate it using an extensive suite of binarypopulation-synthesis predictions for varying assumptions relating to masstransfer, common-envelope, supernova kicks, remnant masses and wind mass lossphysics. For a 4(10)-year LISA mission, we predict between 30-370(50-550)detections over these variations, out of which 6-154(9-238) are BHBHs,2-198(3-289) are BHNSs and 3-35(4-57) are NSNSs. We discuss how the variationsin the physics assumptions alter the distribution of properties of thedetectable systems, even when the detection rates are unchanged. In particularwe discuss the observable characteristics such as the chirp mass, eccentricityand sky localisation and how the BHBH, BHNS and NSNS populations can bedistinguished, both from each other and from the more numerous double whitedwarf population. We further discuss the possibility of multi-messengerobservations of pulsar populations with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) andassess the benefits of extending the LISA mission.

                                    Current prescriptions for supernova natal kicks in rapid binary populationsynthesis simulations are based on fits of simple functions to single pulsarvelocity data. We explore a new parameterization of natal kicks received byneutron stars in isolated and binary systems developed by Mandel &amp; M\&#34;uller,which is based on 1D and 3D supernova simulations and accounts for the physicalcorrelations between progenitor properties, remnant mass, and the kickvelocity. We constrain two free parameters in this model using very longbaseline interferometry velocity measurements of Galactic single pulsars. Wefind that the inferred values of natal kick parameters do not differsignificantly between single and binary evolution scenarios. The best-fitvalues of these parameters are $v_{\rm ns} = 520$ km s$^{-1}$ for the scalingpre-factor for neutron star kicks, and $\sigma_{\rm ns}=0.3$ for the fractionalstochastic scatter in the kick velocities.

                                    New observational facilities are probing astrophysical transients such asstellar explosions and gravitational wave (GW) sources at ever increasingredshifts, while also revealing new features in source property distributions.To interpret these observations, we need to compare them to predictions fromstellar population models. Such models require the metallicity-dependent cosmicstar formation history ($\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$) as an input. Large uncertaintiesremain in the shape and evolution of this function. In this work, we propose asimple analytical function for $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$. Variations of this functioncan be easily interpreted, because the parameters link to its shape in anintuitive way. We fit our analytical function to the star-forming gas of thecosmological TNG100 simulation and find that it is able to capture the mainbehaviour well. As an example application, we investigate the effect ofsystematic variations in the $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ parameters on the predictedmass distribution of locally merging binary black holes (BBH). Our mainfindings are: I) the locations of features are remarkably robust againstvariations in the metallicity-dependent cosmic star formation history, and II)the low mass end is least affected by these variations. This is promising as itincreases our chances to constrain the physics that governs the formation ofthese objects.

                                    The Milky Way is believed to host hundreds of millions of quiescentstellar-mass black holes (BHs). In the last decade, some of these objects havebeen potentially uncovered via gravitational microlensing events. All thesedetections resulted in a degeneracy between the velocity and the mass of thelens. This degeneracy has been lifted, for the first time, with the recentastrometric microlensing detection of OB110462. However, two independentstudies reported very different lens mass for this event. Sahu et al. (2022)inferred a lens mass of 7.1 $\pm$ 1.3 Msun, consistent with a BH, while Lam etal. (2022) inferred 1.6-4.2 Msun, consistent with either a neutron star or aBH. Here, we study the landscape of isolated BHs formed in the field. Inparticular, we focus on the mass and center-of-mass speed of foursub-populations: isolated BHs from single-star origin, disrupted BHs ofbinary-star origin, main-sequence stars with a compact object companion, anddouble compact object mergers. Our model predicts that most ($\gtrsim$ 50%)isolated BHs in the Milky Way are of binary origin. Moreover, the origin oflow-speed (&lt; 50 km/s) isolated BHs depends on their mass: at least $\approx$70% of low-mass ($\lesssim$ 10 Msun) BHs are from binary origin. Under theassumption that OB110462 is a free-floating compact object, we conclude that itis more likely to be a BH originally belonging to a binary system. Our resultssuggest that low-speed BH microlensing events can be useful to understandbinary evolution of massive stars in the Milky Way.

                                    The spins of merging binary black holes offer insights into their formationhistory. Recently it has been argued that in isolated binary evolution of twomassive stars the firstborn black hole is slowly rotating, whilst theprogenitor of the second-born black hole can be tidally spun up if the binaryis tight enough. Naively, one might therefore expect that only the less massiveblack hole in merging binaries exhibits non-negligible spin. However, if themass ratio of the binary is &#34;reversed&#34; (typically during the first masstransfer episode), it is possible for the tidally spun up second-born to becomethe more massive black hole. We study the properties of such mass-ratioreversed (MRR) binary black hole mergers using a large set of 560 populationsynthesis models. We find that the more massive black hole is formed second in$\gtrsim 70\%$ of binary black holes observable by LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA formost model variations we consider, with typical total masses $\gtrsim 20$M$_{\odot}$ and mass ratios $q = m_2 / m_1 \sim 0.7$ (where $m_1 &gt; m_2$). Theformation history of these systems typically involves only stable mass transferepisodes. The second-born black hole has non-negligible spin ($\chi &gt; 0.05$) inup to $25\%$ of binary black holes, with among those the more (less) massiveblack hole spinning in $0\%$--$80\%$ ($20\%$--$100\%$) of cases, varyinggreatly in our models. We discuss our models in the context of several observedgravitational-wave events and the observed mass ratio - effective spincorrelation.

                                    Neutron stars receive velocity kicks at birth in supernovae. Those formed inelectron-capture supernovae from super asymptotic giant branch stars -- thelowest mass stars to end their lives in supernovae -- may receive significantlylower kicks than typical neutron stars. Given that many massive stars aremembers of wide binaries, this suggests the existence of a population oflow-mass ($1.25 &lt; M_\mathrm{psr} / $M$_\odot &lt; 1.3$), wide ($P_\mathrm{orb}\gtrsim 10^{4}$\,day), eccentric ($e \sim 0.7$), unrecycled ($P_\mathrm{spin}\sim 1$\,s) binary pulsars. The formation rate of such binaries is sensitive tothe mass range of (effectively) single stars leading to electron capturesupernovae, the amount of mass lost prior to the supernova, and the magnitudeof any natal kick imparted on the neutron star. We estimate that one suchbinary pulsar should be observable in the Milky Way for every 10,000 isolatedpulsars, assuming that the width of the mass range of single stars leading toelectron-capture supernovae is $\lesssim 0.2$\,M$_\odot$, and that neutronstars formed in electron-capture supernovae receive typical kicks less than10\,km s$^{-1}$. We have searched the catalog of observed binary pulsars, butfind no convincing candidates that could be formed through this channel,consistent with this low predicted rate. Future observations with the SquareKilometre Array may detect this rare sub-class of binary pulsar and providestrong constraints on the properties of electron-capture supernovae and theirprogenitors.

                                    and

                                    arepredominantly impacted by

                                    changes. For BHBH andNSNS we
                                    find that both uncertainties
                                    are important. We also find

                                    BHNS and NSNS. We
                                    identifyseveral examples of
                                    robust features in the mass

                                    all560 models, such that we
                                    expect more than 95% of BHBH
                                    detections to contain aBH
                                    $\gtrsim 8\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and
                                    have mass ratios $\lesssim 4$.
                                    Our workdemonstrates that it is

                                    <p>Gravitational wave detectors
                                    are starting to reveal the
                                    redshift evolution of the
                                    binary black hole (BBH) merger
                                    rate, RBBH(z). We make
                                    predictions for RBBH(z) as a
                                    function of black hole mass for
                                    systems originating from
                                    isolated binaries. To this end,
                                    we investigate correlations
                                    between the delay time and
                                    black hole mass by means of the
                                    suite of binary population
                                    synthesis simulations, COMPAS.
                                    We distinguish two channels:
                                    the common envelope (CE), and
                                    the stable Roche-lobe overflow
                                    (RLOF) channel, characterised
                                    by whether the system has
                                    experienced a common envelope
                                    or not. We find that the CE
                                    channel preferentially produces
                                    BHs with masses below about
                                    30M⊙ and short delay times
                                    (tdelay≲1Gyr), while the stable
                                    RLOF channel primarily forms
                                    systems with BH masses above
                                    30M⊙ and long delay times
                                    (tdelay≳1Gyr). We provide a new
                                    fit for the metallicity
                                    specific star-formation rate
                                    density based on the Illustris
                                    TNG simulations, and use this
                                    to convert the delay time
                                    distributions into a prediction
                                    of RBBH(z). This leads to a
                                    distinct redshift evolution of
                                    RBBH(z) for high and low
                                    primary BH masses. We
                                    furthermore find that, at high
                                    redshift, RBBH(z) is dominated
                                    by the CE channel, while at low
                                    redshift it contains a large
                                    contribution (∼40%) from the
                                    stable RLOF channel. Our
                                    results predict that, for
                                    increasing redshifts, BBHs with
                                    component masses above 30M⊙
                                    will become increasingly scarce
                                    relative to less massive BBH
                                    systems. Evidence of this
                                    distinct evolution of RBBH(z)
                                    for different BH masses can be
                                    tested with future

                                    <p>The LIGO/Virgo
                                    gravitational--wave
                                    observatories have detected 50
                                    BH-BH coalescences. This sample
                                    is large enough to have allowed
                                    several recent studies to draw
                                    conclusions about the branching
                                    ratios between isolated
                                    binaries versus dense stellar
                                    clusters as the origin of
                                    double BHs. It has also led to
                                    the exciting suggestion that
                                    the population is highly likely
                                    to contain primordial black
                                    holes. Here we demonstrate that
                                    such conclusions cannot yet be
                                    robust, because of the large
                                    current uncertainties in
                                    several key aspects of binary
                                    stellar evolution. These
                                    include the development and
                                    survival of a common envelope,
                                    the mass and angular momentum
                                    loss during binary
                                    interactions, mixing in stellar
                                    interiors, pair-instability
                                    mass loss and supernova
                                    outbursts. Using standard tools
                                    such as the population
                                    synthesis codes StarTrack and
                                    COMPAS and the detailed stellar
                                    evolution code MESA, we examine
                                    as a case study the possible
                                    future evolution of Melnick 34,
                                    the most massive known binary
                                    star system. We show that,
                                    despite its well-known orbital
                                    architecture, various
                                    assumptions regarding stellar
                                    and binary physics predict a
                                    wide variety of outcomes: from
                                    a close BH-BH binary (which
                                    would lead to a potentially
                                    detectable coalescence),
                                    through a wide BH-BH binary
                                    (which might be seen in
                                    microlensing observations), or
                                    a Thorne-Zytkow object, to a
                                    complete disruption of both
                                    objects by pair-instability
                                    supernovae. Thus since the
                                    future of massive binaries is
                                    inherently uncertain, sound
                                    predictions about the
                                    properties of BH-BH systems are
                                    highly challenging at this
                                    time. Consequently, drawing
                                    conclusions about the formation

                                    <p>In this work we study the
                                    formation of the first two
                                    black hole-neutron star (BHNS)
                                    mergers detected in
                                    gravitational waves (GW200115
                                    and GW200105) from massive
                                    stars in wide isolated binary
                                    systems - the isolated binary
                                    evolution channel. We use 560
                                    BHNS binary population
                                    synthesis model realizations
                                    from Broekgaarden et al.
                                    (2021a) and show that the
                                    system properties (chirp mass,
                                    component masses and mass
                                    ratios) of both GW200115 and
                                    GW200105 match predictions from
                                    the isolated binary evolution
                                    channel. We also show that most
                                    model realizations can account
                                    for the local BHNS merger rate
                                    densities inferred by
                                    LIGO-Virgo. However, to
                                    simultaneously also match the
                                    inferred local merger rate
                                    densities for BHBH and NSNS
                                    systems we find we need models
                                    with moderate kick velocities
                                    (σ≲102kms−1) or high
                                    common-envelope efficiencies

                                    explorations. We conclude that
                                    the first two observed BHNS
                                    mergers can be explained from
                                    the isolated binary evolution

                                    would predominantly escape,
                                    while wide binaries would be
                                    disrupted. On the other hand,
                                    observations of transverse

                                    pulsars indicate that only
                                    $5\pm2\%$ have velocities below
                                    \unit[50]{\kms}. We explore
                                    this apparent tension with
                                    rapid binary population
                                    synthesis modelling. We propose
                                    a model in which supernovae
                                    with characteristically low
                                    natal kicks (e.g.,
                                    electron-capture supernovae)
                                    only occur if the progenitor
                                    star has been stripped via
                                    binary interaction with a
                                    companion. We show that this
                                    model naturally reproduces the
                                    observed pulsar speed

                                    <p>In this paper, a fast and
                                    parallelizable method based on
                                    Gaussian Processes (GPs) is
                                    introduced to emulate computer
                                    models that simulate the
                                    formation of binary black holes
                                    (BBHs) through the evolution of
                                    pairs of massive stars. Two
                                    obstacles that arise in this
                                    application are the a priori
                                    unknown conditions of BBH
                                    formation and the large scale
                                    of the simulation data. We
                                    address them by proposing a
                                    local emulator which combines a
                                    GP classifier and a GP
                                    regression model. The resulting
                                    emulator can also be utilized
                                    in planning future computer
                                    simulations through a proposed
                                    criterion for sequential
                                    design. By propagating
                                    uncertainties of simulation
                                    input through the emulator, we
                                    are able to obtain the
                                    distribution of BBH properties
                                    under the distribution of
                                    physical parameters.</p>

                                    (GW) detectors in the coming
                                    years. Such observations will
                                    not only provide confirmation
                                    that these systems exist, but
                                    will also give unique insights
                                    into the death of massive

                                    ground-based GW observatories.

                                    that explore key uncertainties
                                    in our assumptions about
                                    massive binary star evolution
                                    (e.g., mass transfer,
                                    common-envelope evolution,
                                    supernovae), and in our
                                    assumptions for the

                                    impacts on our predictions. We
                                    predict intrinsic local BHNS
                                    merger rates in the range R^0_m
                                    ≈ 4–830 Gpc−3 yr−1 and detected
                                    rates in the range Rdet ≈ 1–180
                                    yr−1 for a GW network
                                    consisting of LIGO, Virgo and
                                    KAGRA at design sensitivity. We
                                    find that the binary evolution
                                    and metallicity-specific star
                                    formation rate density each
                                    impact the predicted merger
                                    rates by order O (10). We also
                                    present predictions for the GW
                                    detected BHNS merger properties
                                    and find that all 420 model
                                    variations predict that . 5% of
                                    the BHNS mergers have BH masses
                                    𝑚BH & 18 M, total masses 𝑚tot &
                                    20 M, chirp masses Mc & 5.5 M,
                                    mass ratios 𝑞f & 12 or 𝑞f . 2.
                                    Moreover, we find that massive
                                    NSs with 𝑚NS &gt; 2 M are
                                    expected to be commonly
                                    detected in BHNS mergers in
                                    almost all our model
                                    variations. Finally, a wide
                                    range of ∼ 0%–70% of the BHNS
                                    mergers are predicted to eject
                                    mass during the merger. Our
                                    results highlight the
                                    importance of considering
                                    variations in binary evolution
                                    and cosmological models when
                                    predicting, and eventually

                                    <p>Recent observations of the
                                    high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus
                                    X-1 have shown that both the
                                    companion star (41 solar
                                    masses) and the black hole (21
                                    solar masses) are more massive
                                    than previously estimated.
                                    Furthermore, the black hole
                                    appears to be nearly maximally
                                    spinning. Here we present a
                                    possible formation channel for
                                    the Cygnus X-1 system that
                                    matches the observed system
                                    properties. In this formation
                                    channel, we find that the
                                    orbital parameters of Cygnus
                                    X-1, combined with the observed
                                    metallicity of the companion,
                                    imply a significant reduction
                                    in mass loss through winds
                                    relative to commonly used

                                    <p>The evolution of massive
                                    stars is influenced by the mass
                                    lost to stellar winds over
                                    their lifetimes. These winds
                                    limit the masses of the stellar
                                    remnants (such as black holes)
                                    that the stars ultimately
                                    produce. We use radio
                                    astrometry to refine the
                                    distance to the black hole
                                    X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, which
                                    we find to be 2.22+0.18 −0.17
                                    kiloparsecs. When combined with
                                    previous optical data, this
                                    implies a black hole mass of
                                    21.2±2.2 solar masses, higher
                                    than previous measurements. The
                                    formation of such a high-mass
                                    black hole in a
                                    high-metallicity system

                                    <p>Binaries comprised of a
                                    neutron star (NS) and a black
                                    hole (BH) have so far eluded
                                    observations as pulsars and
                                    with gravitational waves (GWs).
                                    We model the formation and
                                    evolution of these NS+BH
                                    binaries including pulsar
                                    evolution using the binary
                                    population synthesis code
                                    COMPAS. We predict the presence
                                    of a total of 50-1300 binaries
                                    containing a pulsar and a BH
                                    (PSR+BHs) in the Galactic
                                    field. We find the population
                                    observable by the
                                    next-generation of radio
                                    telescopes, represented by the
                                    SKA and MeerKAT, current
                                    (LIGO/Virgo) and future (LISA)
                                    GW detectors. We conclude that
                                    the SKA will observe 1-60
                                    PSR+BHs, with 0-4 binaries
                                    containing millisecond pulsars.
                                    MeerKAT is expected to observe
                                    0-30 PSR+BH systems. Future
                                    radio detections of NS+BHs will
                                    constrain uncertain binary
                                    evolution processes such as BH
                                    natal kicks. We show that
                                    systems in which the NS formed
                                    first (NSBH) can be
                                    distinguished from those where
                                    the BH formed first (BHNS) by
                                    their pulsar and binary
                                    properties. We find 40% of the

                                    a Milky-Way like field
                                    population will have a chirp
                                    mass ≥3.0 M⊙. We estimate the
                                    spin distributions of NS+BHs
                                    with two models for the spins
                                    of BHs. The remnants of BHNS
                                    mergers will have a spin of
                                    ∼0.4, whilst NSBH merger
                                    remnants can have a spin of
                                    ∼0.6 or ∼0.9 depending on the
                                    model for BH spins. We estimate
                                    that approximately 25-930
                                    PSR+BHs will be radio alive

                                    <p>Stellar triples with massive
                                    stellar components are common,
                                    and can lead to sequential
                                    binary black-hole mergers.
                                    Here, we outline the evolution
                                    towards these sequential
                                    mergers, and explore these
                                    events in the context of
                                    gravitational-wave astronomy
                                    and the pair-instability mass
                                    gap. We find that binary
                                    black-hole mergers in the
                                    pair-instability mass gap can
                                    be of triple origin and
                                    therefore are not exclusively
                                    formed in dense dynamical
                                    environments. We discuss the
                                    sequential merger scenario in
                                    the context of the most massive
                                    gravitational-wave sources
                                    detected to date: GW170729 and
                                    GW190521. We propose that the
                                    progenitor of GW170729 is a
                                    low-metallicity field triple.
                                    We support the premise that
                                    GW190521 could not have been
                                    formed in the field. We
                                    conclude that triple stellar
                                    evolution is fundamental in the
                                    understanding of
                                    gravitational-wave sources, and
                                    likely, other energetic

                                    <p>We explore chemically
                                    homogeneous evolution (CHE) as
                                    a formation channel for massive
                                    merging binary black holes
                                    (BBHs). We develop methods to
                                    include CHE in a rapid binary
                                    population synthesis code,

                                    Statistics (COMPAS), which
                                    combines realistic models of
                                    binary evolution with
                                    cosmological models of the
                                    star-formation history of the
                                    Universe. For the first time,
                                    we simultaneously explore
                                    conventional isolated binary
                                    star evolution under the same
                                    set of assumptions. This
                                    approach allows us to constrain
                                    population properties and make
                                    simultaneous predictions about
                                    the gravitational-wave
                                    detection rates of BBH mergers
                                    for the CHE and conventional
                                    formation channels. The overall
                                    mass distribution of detectable
                                    BBHs is consistent with
                                    existing gravitational-wave
                                    observations. We find that the
                                    CHE channel may yield up to
                                    ~70% of all gravitational-wave

                                    <p>We report on the impact of a
                                    probabilistic prescription for
                                    compact remnant masses and
                                    spins on massive binary
                                    population synthesis. We find
                                    that this prescription
                                    populates the putative mass gap
                                    between neutron stars and black
                                    holes with low-mass black
                                    holes. However, evolutionary
                                    effects reduce the number of
                                    X-ray binary candidates with
                                    low-mass black holes,
                                    consistent with the dearth of
                                    such systems in the observed
                                    sample. We further find that
                                    this prescription is consistent

                                    <p>Based on recent results from
                                    three-dimensional supernova
                                    simulations and semianalytical
                                    parametrised models, we develop
                                    analytical prescriptions for
                                    the dependence of the mass of
                                    neutron stars and black holes
                                    and the natal kicks, if any, on
                                    the presupernova carbon-oxygen
                                    core and helium shell masses.
                                    Our recipes are probabilistic
                                    rather than deterministic in
                                    order to account for the
                                    intrinsic stochasticity of
                                    stellar evolution and
                                    supernovae. We anticipate that
                                    these recipes will be
                                    particularly useful for rapid
                                    population synthesis, and we
                                    illustrate their application to
                                    distributions of remnant masses
                                    and kicks for a population of
                                    single stars.</p>

                                    <p>The theory for single
                                    stellar evolution predicts a
                                    gap in the mass distribution of
                                    black holes (BHs) between
                                    approximately 45--130\Msun, the
                                    so-called ``the
                                    pair-instability mass gap". We
                                    examine whether BHs can pollute
                                    the gap after accreting from a
                                    stellar companion. To this end,
                                    we simulate the evolution of
                                    isolated binaries using a
                                    population synthesis code,
                                    where we allow for
                                    super-Eddington accretion.
                                    Under our most extreme
                                    assumptions, we find that at
                                    most about 2\% of all merging
                                    binary BH systems contains a BH
                                    with a mass in the
                                    pair-instability mass gap, and
                                    we find that less than 0.5\% of
                                    the merging systems has a total
                                    mass larger than 90\Msun. We
                                    find no merging binary BH
                                    systems with a total mass
                                    exceeding 100\Msun. We compare
                                    our results to predictions from
                                    several dynamical pathways to
                                    pair-instability mass gap
                                    events and discuss the
                                    distinguishable features. We
                                    conclude that the classical
                                    isolated binary formation
                                    scenario will not significantly
                                    contribute to the pollution of
                                    the pair-instability mass gap.
                                    The robustness of the predicted
                                    mass gap for the isolated
                                    binary channel is promising for
                                    the prospective of placing
                                    constraints on (i) the relative
                                    contribution of different
                                    formation channels, (ii) the

                                    code. We focus on the
                                    apparently higher minimal mass
                                    of Be stars in BeXRBs than in
                                    the Be population at large.
                                    Assuming that BeXRBs
                                    experienced only dynamically

                                    mass distribution suggests that
                                    at least ~30% of the mass
                                    donated by the progenitor of

                                    companion. We expect these
                                    results to affect predictions
                                    for the population of double

                                    <p>We have implemented
                                    prescriptions for modelling
                                    pulsars in the rapid binary
                                    population synthesis code
                                    COMPAS. We perform a detailed
                                    analysis of the double neutron
                                    star (DNS) population,
                                    accounting for radio survey
                                    selection effects. The surface
                                    magnetic field decay timescale
                                    (~1000 Myr) and mass scale
                                    (~0.02 solar masses) are the
                                    dominant uncertainties in our
                                    model. Mass accretion during
                                    common envelope evolution plays
                                    a non-trivial role in recycling
                                    pulsars. We find a best-fit
                                    model that is in broad
                                    agreement with the observed
                                    Galactic DNS population. Though
                                    the pulsar parameters (period
                                    and period derivative) are
                                    strongly biased by radio
                                    selection effects, the observed
                                    orbital parameters (orbital
                                    period and eccentricity)
                                    closely represent the intrinsic
                                    distributions. The number of
                                    radio observable DNSs in the
                                    Milky Way at present is ~2500
                                    in our model, only ~10% of the
                                    predicted total number of DNSs
                                    in the galaxy. Using our model
                                    calibrated to the Galactic DNS
                                    population, we make predictions
                                    for DNS mergers observed in
                                    gravitational waves. The DNS
                                    chirp mass distribution varies
                                    from ~1.2 to ~2.1 solar masses
                                    and median is obtained to be
                                    1.14 solar masses. The expected
                                    effective spin chi_eff for
                                    isolated DNSs is less than
                                    approximately 0.03 from our
                                    model. We predict that ~34% of
                                    the current Galactic isolated
                                    DNSs will merge within a Hubble
                                    time, and have a median total
                                    mass of 2.7 solar masses.
                                    Finally, we discuss
                                    implications for fast radio
                                    bursts and post-merger remnant

                                    <p>Close Double Neutron Stars
                                    (DNSs) have been observed as
                                    Galactic radio pulsars, while
                                    their mergers have been
                                    detected as gamma-ray bursts
                                    and gravitational-wave sources.
                                    They are believed to have
                                    experienced at least one
                                    common-envelope episode (CEE)
                                    during their evolution prior to
                                    DNS formation. In the last
                                    decades there have been
                                    numerous efforts to understand
                                    the details of the
                                    common-envelope phase, but its
                                    computational modelling remains
                                    challenging. We present and
                                    discuss the properties of the
                                    donor and the binary at the
                                    onset of the Roche-lobe
                                    overflow (RLOF) leading to
                                    these CEEs as predicted by
                                    rapid binary population
                                    synthesis models. These
                                    properties can be used as
                                    initial conditions for detailed
                                    simulations of the
                                    common-envelope phase. There
                                    are three distinctive
                                    populations, classified by the
                                    evolutionary stage of the donor
                                    at the moment of the onset of
                                    the RLOF: giant donors with
                                    fully-convective envelopes,
                                    cool donors with
                                    partially-convective envelopes,
                                    and hot donors with radiative
                                    envelopes. We also estimate
                                    that, for standard assumptions,
                                    tides would not circularise a
                                    large fraction of these systems
                                    by the onset of RLOF. This

                                    <p>A class of optical
                                    transients known as Luminous
                                    Red Novae (LRNe) have recently
                                    been associated with mass
                                    ejections from binary stars
                                    undergoing common-envelope
                                    evolution. We use the
                                    population synthesis code
                                    COMPAS to explore the impact of
                                    a range of assumptions about
                                    the physics of common-envelope
                                    evolution on the properties of
                                    LRNe. In particular, we
                                    investigate the influence of
                                    various models for the
                                    energetics of LRNe on the
                                    expected event rate and light
                                    curve characteristics, and
                                    compare with the existing
                                    sample. We find that the
                                    Galactic rate of LRNe is ~0.2-1
                                    per year in agreement with the
                                    observed rate. In our models,
                                    the luminosity function of
                                    Galactic LRNe covers multiple
                                    decades in luminosity and is
                                    dominated by signals from
                                    stellar mergers, consistent
                                    with observational constraints
                                    from iPTF and the Galactic
                                    sample of LRNe. We discuss how
                                    observations of the brightest
                                    LRNe may provide indirect
                                    evidence for the existence of
                                    massive (&gt;40 solar mass) red
                                    supergiants. Such LRNe could be
                                    markers along the evolutionary
                                    pathway leading to the
                                    formation of double compact
                                    objects. We make predictions
                                    for the population of LRNe
                                    observable in future transient
                                    surveys with the Large Synoptic
                                    Survey Telescope and the Zwicky
                                    Transient Facility. In all
                                    plausible circumstances, we
                                    predict a selection-limited
                                    observable population dominated
                                    by bright, long-duration events
                                    caused by common envelope
                                    ejections. We show that the
                                    Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
                                    will observe 20--750 LRNe per
                                    year, quickly constraining the
                                    luminosity function of LRNe and
                                    probing the physics of
                                    common-envelope events.</p>

                                    <p>We estimate the properties
                                    of the double neutron star
                                    (DNS) population that will be
                                    observable by the planned
                                    space-based interferometer
                                    LISA. By following the
                                    gravitational radiation driven
                                    evolution of DNSs generated
                                    from rapid population synthesis
                                    of massive binary stars, we
                                    estimate that around 35 DNSs
                                    will accumulate a
                                    signal-to-noise ratio above 8
                                    over a four-year LISA mission.
                                    The observed population mainly
                                    comprises Galactic DNSs (94 per
                                    cent), but detections in the
                                    LMC (5 per cent) and SMC (1 per
                                    cent) may also be expected. The
                                    median orbital frequency of
                                    detected DNSs is expected to be
                                    0.8 mHz, and many of them will
                                    be eccentric (median
                                    eccentricity of 0.11). The
                                    orbital properties will provide
                                    insights into DNS progenitors
                                    and formation channels. LISA is
                                    expected to localise these DNSs
                                    to a typical angular resolution
                                    of 2∘, with best-constrained
                                    sources localised to a few
                                    arcminutes. These localisations
                                    may allow neutron star natal
                                    kick magnitudes to be
                                    constrained through the
                                    Galactic distribution of DNSs,
                                    and make it possible to follow
                                    up the sources with radio
                                    pulsar searches. However, LISA
                                    is also expected to resolve
                                    ∼104 Galactic double white
                                    dwarfs, many of which may have
                                    binary parameters that resemble
                                    DNSs; we discuss how the
                                    combined measurement of binary
                                    eccentricity, chirp mass, and
                                    sky location may aid the
                                    identification of a DNS. We
                                    expect the best-constrained
                                    DNSs to have eccentricities
                                    known to a few parts in a
                                    thousand, chirp masses measured
                                    to better than 1 per cent
                                    fractional uncertainty, and sky
                                    localisation at the level of a

                                    <p>A population of binary black
                                    hole mergers has now been
                                    observed in gravitational waves
                                    by Advanced LIGO and Virgo. The
                                    masses of these black holes
                                    appear to show evidence for a
                                    pile-up between
                                    $30$--$45$\,\Msol{} and a
                                    cut-off above $\sim 45$\,\Msol.
                                    One possible explanation for
                                    such a pile-up and subsequent
                                    cut-off are pulsational
                                    pair-instability supernovae
                                    (PPISNe) and pair-instability
                                    supernovae (PISNe) in massive
                                    stars. We investigate the
                                    plausibility of this
                                    explanation in the context of
                                    isolated massive binaries. We
                                    study a population of massive
                                    binaries using the rapid
                                    population synthesis software
                                    COMPAS, incorporating models
                                    for PPISNe and PISNe. Our
                                    models predict a maximum black
                                    hole mass of $40$\,\Msol{}. We
                                    expect $\sim 0.5$--$4$\% of all
                                    binary black hole mergers at
                                    redshift z = 0 will include at
                                    least one component that went
                                    through a PPISN (with mass
                                    $30$--$40$\,\Msol{}),
                                    constituting $\sim 5$--$25$\%
                                    of binary black hole mergers
                                    observed during the first two
                                    observing runs of Advanced LIGO
                                    and Virgo. Empirical models
                                    based on fitting the
                                    gravitational-wave mass
                                    measurements to a combination
                                    of a power law and a Gaussian
                                    find a fraction too large to be
                                    associated with PPISNe in our
                                    models. The rates of PPISNe and
                                    PISNe track the low metallicity
                                    star formation rate, increasing
                                    out to redshift $z = 2$. These
                                    predictions may be tested both
                                    with future gravitational-wave
                                    observations and with

                                    <p>We investigate the impact of
                                    uncertainty in the
                                    metallicity-specific star
                                    formation rate over cosmic time
                                    on predictions of the rates and
                                    masses of double compact object
                                    mergers observable through
                                    gravitational waves. We find
                                    that this uncertainty can
                                    change the predicted detectable
                                    merger rate by more than an
                                    order of magnitude, comparable
                                    to contributions from uncertain
                                    physical assumptions regarding
                                    binary evolution, such as mass
                                    transfer efficiency or
                                    supernova kicks. We
                                    statistically compare the
                                    results produced by the COMPAS
                                    population synthesis suite
                                    against a catalog of

                                    from the first two Advanced
                                    LIGO and Virgo observing runs.
                                    We find that the rate and chirp
                                    mass of observed binary black
                                    hole mergers can be well
                                    matched under our default
                                    evolutionary model with a star
                                    formation metallicity spread of
                                    0.39 dex around a mean
                                    metallicity ⟨Z⟩ that scales
                                    with redshift z as
                                    ⟨Z⟩=0.035×10−0.23z, assuming a
                                    star formation rate of
                                    0.01×(1+z)2.77/(1+((1+z)/2.9)4.7)M⊙
                                    Mpc−3 yr−1. Intriguingly, this
                                    default model predicts that
                                    80\% of the approximately one

                                    via the evolution of isolated
                                    field binaries that go through

                                    and metallicity-dependent
                                    star-formation rate and the

                                    gravitational-wave detectors to
                                    obtain predictions of
                                    observable properties. By
                                    assuming efficient angular
                                    momentum transport, we are able
                                    to present a model capable of
                                    predicting simultaneously the
                                    three main gravitational-wave
                                    observables: the effective
                                    inspiral spin parameter χeff,
                                    the chirp mass Mchirp and the
                                    cosmological redshift of merger
                                    zmerger. We find an excellent
                                    agreement between our model and
                                    the ten events from the first
                                    two advanced detector observing
                                    runs. We make predictions for
                                    the third observing run O3 and
                                    for Advanced LIGO design
                                    sensitivity. We expect 59% of
                                    events with χeff&lt;0.1, while
                                    the remaining 41% of events
                                    with χeff≥0.1 are split into 9%
                                    with Mchirp&lt;15 M⊙ and 32%
                                    with Mchirp≥15 M⊙. In
                                    conclusion, the favorable
                                    comparison of the existing
                                    LIGO/Virgo observations with
                                    our model predictions gives
                                    support to the idea that the
                                    majority, if not all of the
                                    observed mergers, originate
                                    from the evolution of isolated
                                    binaries. The first-born black
                                    hole has negligible spin
                                    because it lost its envelope
                                    after it expanded to become a
                                    giant star, while the spin of
                                    the second-born black hole is
                                    determined by the tidal spin up
                                    of its naked helium star
                                    progenitor by the first-born
                                    black hole companion after the
                                    binary finished the
                                    common-envelope phase.</p>

                                    <p>Gravitational-wave
                                    observations of double compact
                                    object (DCO) mergers are
                                    providing new insights into the
                                    physics of massive stars and
                                    the evolution of binary
                                    systems. Making the most of
                                    expected near-future
                                    observations for understanding
                                    stellar physics will rely on
                                    comparisons with binary
                                    population synthesis models.
                                    However, the vast majority of
                                    simulated binaries never
                                    produce DCOs, which makes
                                    calculating such populations
                                    computationally inefficient. We
                                    present an importance sampling
                                    algorithm, STROOPWAFEL, that
                                    improves the computational
                                    efficiency of population
                                    studies of rare events, by
                                    focusing the simulation around
                                    regions of the initial
                                    parameter space found to
                                    produce outputs of interest. We
                                    implement the algorithm in the
                                    binary population synthesis
                                    code COMPAS, and compare the
                                    efficiency of our
                                    implementation to the standard
                                    method of Monte Carlo sampling
                                    from the birth probability
                                    distributions. STROOPWAFEL
                                    finds $\sim$25-200 times more
                                    DCO mergers than the standard
                                    sampling method with the same
                                    simulation size, and so speeds
                                    up simulations by up to two
                                    orders of magnitude. Finding
                                    more DCO mergers automatically
                                    maps the parameter space with
                                    far higher resolution than when
                                    using the traditional sampling.
                                    This increase in efficiency
                                    also leads to a decrease of a
                                    factor $\sim$3-10 in
                                    statistical sampling
                                    uncertainty for the predictions
                                    from the simulations. This is
                                    particularly notable for the
                                    distribution functions of
                                    observable quantities such as
                                    the black hole and neutron star
                                    chirp mass distribution,
                                    including in the tails of the
                                    distribution functions where
                                    predictions using standard
                                    sampling can be dominated by
                                    sampling noise.</p>

                                    surrounding common envelope,
                                    powering a merger-driven
                                    explosion. We use hydrodynamic
                                    models of binary coalescence to
                                    model the common envelope
                                    density distribution at the
                                    time of coalescence. We find
                                    toroidal profiles of material,
                                    concentrated in the binary's
                                    equatorial plane and extending
                                    to many times the massive
                                    star's original radius. We use
                                    the spherically-averaged
                                    properties of this
                                    circumstellar material (CSM) to
                                    estimate the emergent light
                                    curves that result from the
                                    interaction between the blast
                                    wave and the CSM. We find that
                                    typical merger-driven
                                    explosions are brightened by up
                                    to three magnitudes by CSM
                                    interaction. From population
                                    synthesis models we discover
                                    that the brightest
                                    merger-driven explosions,
                                    MV∼−18 to −19, are those
                                    involving black holes because
                                    they have the most massive and
                                    extended CSM. Black hole
                                    coalescence events are also
                                    common; they represent about
                                    50% of all merger-driven
                                    explosions and approximately
                                    0.3% of the core-collapse rate.
                                    Merger-driven explosions offer
                                    a window into the
                                    highly-uncertain physics of
                                    common envelope interactions in
                                    binary systems by probing the
                                    properties of systems that
                                    merge rather than eject their
                                    envelopes.</p>

                                    <p>Double neutron stars (DNSs)
                                    have been observed as Galactic
                                    radio pulsars, and the recent
                                    discovery of gravitational
                                    waves from the DNS merger
                                    GW170817 adds to the known DNS
                                    population. We perform rapid
                                    population synthesis of massive
                                    binary stars and discuss model
                                    predictions, including DNS
                                    formation rates, mass
                                    distributions, and delay time
                                    distributions. We vary
                                    assumptions and parameters of
                                    physical processes such as mass
                                    transfer stability criteria,
                                    supernova natal kick
                                    distributions, remnant mass
                                    prescriptions, and
                                    common-envelope energetics. We
                                    compute the likelihood of
                                    observing the orbital
                                    period-eccentricity
                                    distribution of the Galactic
                                    DNS population under each of
                                    our population synthesis
                                    models, allowing us to
                                    quantitatively compare the
                                    models. We find that mass
                                    transfer from a stripped
                                    post-helium-burning secondary
                                    (case BB) on to a neutron star
                                    is most likely dynamically
                                    stable. We also find that a
                                    natal kick distribution
                                    composed of both low
                                    (Maxwellian σ =30 km s^{-1})
                                    and high (σ =265 km s^{-1})
                                    components is preferred over a
                                    single high-kick component. We
                                    conclude that the observed DNS
                                    mass distribution can place
                                    strong constraints on model
                                    assumptions.</p>

                                    <p>Gravitational waves give us
                                    a unique insight into the
                                    properties of binary black
                                    holes. The information from
                                    gravitational waves should help
                                    us figure out how these black
                                    holes form—in this paper we
                                    investigate exactly how

                                    evolution. We consider

                                    quantify the information we can
                                    gain from observations using
                                    the Fisher matrix, which
                                    includes correlations between
                                    parameters. The plot above
                                    shows (fractional) measurement
                                    uncertainties for many
                                    realisations of the binary
                                    black hole population after
                                    1000 observations (the
                                    uncertainties scale inversely
                                    with the square root of the
                                    number of observations). We
                                    find that we can distinguish
                                    populations which differ by
                                    just a few percent in these
                                    parameters! The measurements
                                    are much better when adding in
                                    the chirp masses as well as the
                                    rates, so perhaps adding in
                                    more information from
                                    gravitational-wave (or other
                                    complementary) observations
                                    will improve things even
                                    further.</p>

                                    we are beginning to collect
                                    observations which will enable
                                    us to explore aspects of
                                    astrophysics of massive stellar
                                    binaries which were previously
                                    beyond reach. In this paper we

                                    <p>In a paper published in
                                    <i>Nature Communications</i>,
                                    we have have shown that all
                                    three observed events can be
                                    formed via the same formation
                                    channel: isolated binary
                                    evolution via a common-envelope
                                    phase. In this channel, two
                                    massive progenitor stars start
                                    out at quite wide separations.
                                    The stars interact as they
                                    expand, engaging in several
                                    episodes of mass transfer. The
                                    latest of these is typically a
                                    common envelope - a very rapid,
                                    dynamically unstable mass
                                    transfer that envelops both
                                    stellar cores in a dense cloud
                                    of hydrogen gas. Ejecting this
                                    gas from the system takes
                                    energy away from the orbit.
                                    This brings the two stars
                                    sufficiently close together for
                                    gravitational-wave emission to
                                    be efficient, right at the time
                                    when they are small enough that
                                    such closeness will no longer
                                    put them into contact. The
                                    whole process takes a few
                                    million years to form two black
                                    holes, with a possible
                                    subsequent delay of billions of
                                    years before the black holes
                                    merge and form a single black
                                    hole.</p>
                                    <p>The simulations have also
                                    helped the team to understand
                                    the typical properties of the
                                    stars that can go on to form
                                    such pairs of merging black
                                    holes and the environments
